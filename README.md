Advent of Unintelligible Code

Challenging myself this year to complete the tasks in as few lines of code as possible. Only rules: no colons or semicolons to group statements in one line, and no excessively long lines.

Empty lines don't count.

The result is unintelligible but hopefully somewhat satisfying code.
